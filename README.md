# Mass-spring-damper cloth simulator

##Overview
Developed as my bachelor's final project, this program simulates cloth dynamics using the
mass-spring-damper model.

##Technology
Programmed in Java using the [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/) library for OpenGL integration.

##How it works
This program supports multiple computer graphics "apps", encapsulating the interface codes.
In order to run it, you must choose the *ClothAppSettings.settings* file from the File -> Open
menu when prompted.

Controls are as follows:

**Left mouse button:** rotates the camera;
**Right mouse button:** moves the camera;
**Mouse wheel:** zooms in and out;
**Space bar:** loads an app from its .settings file;
**Enter:** runs the app;
**Up arrow:** resets the camera position;
